                    <h3>BIO</h3>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Joe. I am an artist, designer, and educator who thinks deeply about our digital culture and how creatives can shape the future. I believe that collaboration across disciplines is the best way to make meaningful change. As a design educator, I emphasize a human-centered approach to help students of all ages identify and tackle problems small and large. <a id="toggle-link" href="javascript:void(0);">more > <span id="toggle-icon" class="right-arrow"></span></a></p>

                    <div id="additional-content" style="display: none;"></div>
                      <p class="responsive-indent">I practice what I preach. My research is highly collaborative, bringing together art, design, science, engineering, agriculture, and public health professionals to address real world issues. Research teams that I helped assemble have received nearly one million dollars in funding from State and Federal funding agencies. These funds support a wide range of ongoing research projects including efforts to reduce PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution from agricultural burning in rural communities to developing new tools for students with dyslexia.</p>

                      <p class="responsive-indent">I am also the founder of <a href="https://cumulus-tech.com" target="_blank">Cumulus Tech</a>, a startup that leverages design thinking and emerging technologies like augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and game design to address public health, education, agriculture and tourism challenges in the Mississippi River Delta. </p>

                      <p class="responsive-indent">When I'm not doing these things I'm playing tennis and goofing off with my silly and brilliant daughter and bringing old houses back to life with my <a href="https://www.carasullivan.com/index.html" target="_blank">incredibly talented wife</a>. The common thread that runs through everything I do is a passion for finding creative solutions to complex problems and making a positive impact on the world around me.</p>
